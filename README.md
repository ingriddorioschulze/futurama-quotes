# about

Futurama Quotes is personal project that turned in to be a really nice and fun coding challenge. As a fan of Futurama, I wanted to develop an application where users can search for characters and see all their quotes.

# features

## search

Users are welcomed to the page with the Futurama logo and a search field. After the search for a favorite character, the results will be displayed in cards with the character's name and picture.

## quotes

For the characters that have available quotes a button will be displayed. Clicking on the button a modal will appear with the character's quotes. To go back to the search the user needs to hit the "back" button or close the modal.
